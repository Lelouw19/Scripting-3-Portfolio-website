     <p>The cover of my Portfolio represents my personal interests.
        The meaning also helped me pursue Game Development as I hope to 
        enter the design part of the game industry. 
        I have always been fascinated by the way games are developed 
        with the art designs of character, environment 
        and the functions used to getting things to be playable. 
        
        When taking Game Design I knew it would not be easy making a game from 
        start as it would involve programming, theory and making of playable characters.
        The difficult part is making sure it is functional and my lecturer is able to 
        access the game which can be very challenging.
        This Portfolio will explore things I have learned when doing this module and 
        my work from my time studying game development.</p>
